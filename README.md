<br><br>
You can pray for anything. To anyone. You can see prayers all over the world. 

### Technologies Used

<br><br>
Prayers Gonna Pray is built with mongoDB, Express, React, and Node. 
<br><br>
Materialize CSS library is used for styling as well as the react-materialize npm module. 
<br><br>
The Google geolocation API is used to fetch user locations. 
A publicly available Google Maps key was used for the maps. 
<br><br>
JSON webtokens are used for authorization. 


### Getting Started

This [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/ftzzpf8q/prayers-gonna-pray) was used to plan and track my progress.

### Unsolved Problems
- A "real" Google Maps API key requires a payment so at the moment the map says *For Development Purposes Only* all over it.
- There is no email verification system and users cannot delete their accounts yet. 
- There still seem to be some bugs that occasionally pop up with API calls. The userdashboard can be particularly slow to load. This could be improved. 

### Future Enhancements
- The map markers will be clickable so a user can view the prayers made in that location
- Socially polling so users can vote for the side of good or the side of bad. 
- FAQ, About, and Terms of Use pages.
